    <h3>What are my responsibilities when using the digital files available through this website?</h3>

    <p>Many collection materials in the DCR are made available openly or by ONYEN authentication without requiring
        registration with the Wilson Special Collections Library. However, the materials are still governed by the Wilson
        Special Collections Library's Policies Governing Use. When you are use materials from the Repository, you
        should acknowledge and follow the following policies:</p>

    <h3>Policies Governing Use</h3>

    <p>Researchers agree to abide by restrictions placed on the library’s collections.</p>
    <p>Collection materials including unpublished documents may be subject to laws governing copyright
        (Title 17, U.S. Code). Digital files are made for private study and reference. Permission of the copyright
        holder may be required for uses exceeding "fair use." Researchers acknowledge that they are solely responsible
        for determining the copyright status of the materials they use.</p>
    <p>Manuscript collections and archival records that include twentieth and twenty-first century materials may
        contain sensitive or confidential information that is protected under federal or state right to privacy laws
        and regulations, the North Carolina Public Records Act (N.C.G.S. &sect; 132 1 et seq.), and Article 7 of the North
        Carolina State Personnel Act (Privacy of State Employee Personnel Records, N.C.G.S. &sect; 126-22 et seq.). Researchers
        are advised that the disclosure of certain information pertaining to identifiable living individuals without the
        consent of those individuals may have legal ramifications (e.g., a cause of action under common law for invasion
        of privacy may arise if facts concerning an individual's private life are published that would be deemed
        highly offensive to a reasonable person).</p>
    <p>The University Archives at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill operates in accordance with the
        North Carolina Public Records Act (N.C.G.S. &sect; 132 1 et seq.) providing unrestricted access to university
        records not covered by state and federal right to privacy acts.</p>
    <p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and their libraries, assume no responsibility for infringement of
        literary property rights and copyright or for liability to any person for defamation or invasion of privacy
        that results from a researcher's use of collections.</p>
    <p>Researchers agree to indemnify and hold harmless the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and their
        officers, employees, and agents from and against all suits, claims, actions, and expenses arising out of use
        of collections held by the libraries.</p>

    <h3>How We Preserve Digital Materials</h3>

    <p>Much of the material available in the Digital Collections Repository were acquired by the Library on various
        types of digital storage devices and via cloud storage. The storage devices range from floppy disks to DVDs
        to USB drives to Dropbox. In order to preserve the materials effectively we must carefully migrate the digital
        files to storage that is contemporary and optimized for long-term preservation. We employ best practices to analyze
        and migrate digital files from donated storage devices to the Digital Collections Repository
        for preservation and access.</p>
    <p>As a result of the legacy nature of some of the digital materials we receive, some digital files are difficult
        to access with contemporary software. This also means that some files may be inaccessible at present. As it
        becomes possible to do so, we will expand and improve access to legacy file formats based on emerging best
        practices and tool development.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about access to files, file formats, or storage devices used to transfer the materials to
        the Library, please contact us for more information.</p>
